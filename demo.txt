This is a demo for Copilot Orchestration.
Right now, we already have several Copilots—like Help Search, Intacct Insights, and Trigger JB demoed yesterday —
and we want to bring them together under a single UI to improve the user experience.

We think of these Copilots as individual skills. Depending on the user’s profile and company configuration, different skills may be available.

And because the available skills can be different, the Copilot’s response might also be different.

================================================================================

1. no skill
how to setup multi book

2. enable 'Help Search' skill
how to setup multi book

3. show public MCP servers: https://mcp.so/

4. enable 'Tavily' skill
search for how to set up a multi-book in Sage Intacct

================================================================================

1. no skill
what's the weather today

2. enable 'Weather' skill
what's the weather today
san jose, ca

3. follow up
how did you get the latitude and longitude info

4. enable 'Tavily' skill
search for San Jose, CA latitude and longitude

================================================================================

# enable 'Model and Query' skill
/skills
list models
show vendor model
find vendors with the highest credit limit and where the credit limit is not null
does the vendor have a name field
what's the name of the vendor with ID SEC

================================================================================

# enable 'Accounts Payable' skill
/skills
create a vendor using random id and name
get vendor details with key 313182

# enable 'Model and Query' skill
/skills
run a query to find a vendor with the id VEND12345 and retrieve the key field

================================================================================

That wraps up the demo portion.
Now I’d love to open it up for

any questions

you might have—feel free to ask about the features,
the orchestration logic, skill activation, or anything else you’re curious about.

I pretend to know all the answers.

================================================================================

To quickly recap:
	•	We saw how different skills like Help Search, Tavily, Weather, and Model & Query can be orchestrated dynamically based on the context.
	•	Depending on which skills are enabled, the Copilot’s behavior changes in real-time to provide more intelligent and relevant responses.
	•	This flexible, modular approach allows us to tailor the experience for each user and organization.

Ultimately, Copilot Orchestration gives us a unified, intelligent, and extensible interface—one that’s adaptive and ready to grow as new skills are introduced.


Thanks again


for joining the demo today! We’re excited about where this is going, and we hope you are too.
